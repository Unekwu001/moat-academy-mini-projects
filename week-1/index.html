				<span style="float:left;"><b>T</b><span>he best way to get your kid interested in programming is to make 
				sure they 
			        create an application that 
				incorporates something they love. The most obvious choice would be to create a video game, but even then,
				not all games are created equal. For instance, some children only like sports games while others may be 
				diehard role-playing game players.
				Several recent studies have found a positive correlation between computer programming and cognitive skills. 
				According to the results, students who knew how to code typically scored higher on cognitive ability tests 
				than those who had little to no
				programming experience. An MIT study also highlighted that computer programming could be advantageous for 
				cognitive development

					<p>As kids learn to code, they become familiar – and ultimately comfortable – with the problem
					-solving process. The more they get used to writing, rewriting, troubleshooting, and debugging lines 
					upon lines of code, the more it becomes second nature for them to cycle through the steps and
					execute them properly.Let’s take developing a video game as an example. Kids will have to write 
					code to make a character walk forwards, backward, and maybe even side to side. They’ll have to
					write code so that the character can jump or dodge. They also have to consider how a character 
					interacts with the environment, and then write code that covers all eventual outcomes following 
					that interaction (i.e., if a character picks up an object, if a character destroys an object,
					if a character uses an object, etc.).</p>
